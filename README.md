# NandToTetris

- my completion for all the projects in [NandToTeris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
- taking this [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) may help
- I referred to [this repository](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/NandToTetris)
- by the way, I use c++ to develop under windows11 and the compiler is gcc 8.1.0
- I did almost no optimizaton on the vm/compiler/os. So it run slow, but it **work**.
